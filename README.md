License Summary
This sample code is made available under a modified MIT license. See the LICENSE file.

Background
Industry professionals in various segments like HealthCare, DataCenter, Cold Storage and Manufacturing are on the lookout for ways to monitor operating environment conditions like temperature remotely to improve operation quality and take data driven intelligent actions. 

In this code we will demonstrate how operations like manufacturing, scientific labs and storage units can enable remote monitoring of environment parameters using Bluetooth sensors and IoT edge gateways to ingest data into the AWS cloud.
